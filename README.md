The AI-Powered Full-Stack Creator Project

This repository contains a series of exercises that build upon each other, starting from fundamental web technologies and culminating in a functional e-commerce storefront built with React and TypeScript.

Project Structure

The project is divided into three main phases, each located in its own directory:

01-html-css-exercise/: A basic exercise focusing on HTML structure and CSS styling to create static web content.

02-typescript-exercises/: An introduction to TypeScript for data modeling, defining the shapes of the data used in the final application.

03-react-app/: The main projectâ€”an interactive e-commerce storefront for a luxury beauty brand.

ðŸ“‚ 01-html-css-exercise

This folder contains a simple, static website created using only HTML and CSS.

Purpose: To practice fundamental web development by building profile cards for K-pop idols.

Contents:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the profile cards.

jennie-kim.jpg, lisa-manobal.jpg: Image assets used in the HTML.

How to View: Simply open the index.html file directly in any web browser.

ðŸ“‚ 02-typescript-exercises

This folder contains TypeScript files focused on defining data structures.

Purpose: To practice data modeling with TypeScript, preparing structured data for use in a larger application.

Contents:

idolStats.ts: Defines an Idol interface and creates objects for different K-pop idols.

makeupPalette.ts: Defines the data structure for makeup products.

How to Use: These are code-only exercises. You can view the code to understand the data structures or compile and run them using a TypeScript compiler (tsc) to see the console output.
